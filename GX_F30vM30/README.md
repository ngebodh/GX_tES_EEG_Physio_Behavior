# Comparing F30 and M30 Stimulation

We examine the effects of brain stimulation on vigilance/attention. 

Here we compare behavioral and physiological outcomes of Experiment 2 of the GX data set. 

We compare outcomes with frontal (F30) and motor (M30) 30 Hz transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS, a transcranial Electrical Stimulation- tES technique).

<em> Figure 1. Comparing effects of F30 and M30 stimulation on vigilance/attentional outcome measures. a) GX dataset Experiment 2 session timeline with 20 min acclimation period followed by 20 trials of stimulation (either F30 or M30 per session). b) Example session where M30 stimulation was applied with concurrent EEG and CTT data (concurrent ECG not shown). c) MRI-derived head model used to visualize stimulation electrode placement for F30 (3X1 HD-tES) and M30 (4X1 HD-tES). d) Example stimulation trial segmented into 30 sec pre, during, and post stimulation. All percent changes were calculated in regard to each trialsâ€™ pre-stimulation period (i.e. see inset); except for the KSS (difference from pre to post session). e) Change in subjective sleepiness before and after each session quantified with the KSS. f) Behavioral change in CTT deviation from pre to post stimulation. g) Behavioral change in CTT deviation from pre to during stimulation. h) Change in RMSSD-based HRV from pre to during stimulation. i) Change in LF/HF ratio-based HRV from pre to during stimulation. j) EEG change in alpha/theta ratio from pre to post stimulation. k) EEG change in delta/theta ratio from pre to post stimulation. f-k depict the average over 20 trials for each participant with group means and standard error of the mean as error bars as well as medians within each boxplot.
