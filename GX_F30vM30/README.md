# Comparing F30 and M30 Stimulation

Here we compare behavioral and physiological outcomes of Experiment 2 of the GX data set. 

We compare outcomes with frontal (F30) and motor (M30) 30 Hz transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS, a transcranial Electrical Stimulation- tES technique).

## Dataset Used

We use the GX dataset. A full data descriptor can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-01046-y) in *Nature Scientific Data*.
